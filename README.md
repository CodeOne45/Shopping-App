# Shopping-App
Shopping App based on tinder swipe feature. Swipe right on a produt to add to cart.

# Description

Straight inspired by the famous Tinder dating app, we decided to take up this concept by adapting it to a much larger audience. As a reminder, the concept of Tinder is to scroll through people's profiles and switch to the right if the person interests you and conversely if you are not interested you switch to the left. This concept being hyper dynamic and interactive we wanted to achieve the same thing but with everyday articles. That's why we created Shopping Swipe - App.

By opening this e-commerce application, a landing page appears, it acts as a loading page and redirects you directly to a login page where you are asked to enter your Username and password. If you are not registered a create button will take you to the register page which will allow you to register for the application. Once on the application, you can change your information (username, password, etc.) via the profile page.


Now that you are logged in, you are faced with a categories page. On this page you will be able to see the different categories of products. This page links directly to the amazon API. Indeed, the different categories present are the Amazon categories. When you click on one of the categories, the products page is displayed. Thus, this page allows you to switch to the right to put the product in your cart or switch to the left to ignore it (you can also put a dislike or a like on the different products) .This page also uses a the amazon API. The goal of using APIs is to have everything (categories + products) updated in real time. Finally, once your shopping is finished, you can go to the basket page to buy the different favorite product (s).
